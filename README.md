In all data structures there is a node object 
which contains the main data have to be stored.
For different purposes you can modify this  - based on the data that you want to store - 
in order to use these data structures.

List of data structures (I am completing this list gradually):

## 1- Stack

Stack is a collection of data in a LIFO (last in, first serve) format. 
It has two main functions:

- Push: for adding a new node to the collection

- Pop: removes and returns the top node from the collection
