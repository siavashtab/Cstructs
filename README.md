In all data structures there is a node type 
which stores the the main data that is going to be stored in the data type 
for different purposes you can modify this  - based on the data that you want to store - 
in order to use the data structures.

List of data structures (I am completing this list gradually):

## 1- stack

stack is a collection of data of LIFO (last in, first serve) stucture. 
It has to main functions:

- Push: for adding a new node to the collection

- Pop: removes and returns the top node in the collection
